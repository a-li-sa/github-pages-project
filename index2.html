      <p>
        Mola molas are related to puffer fish and triggerfish, but they are the largest bony fish in the ocean. They can be found near the surface of the ocean water, basking in the sun to aid digestion and keep their bodies warm. They are often seen lying on their sides, as if they are playing dead.
